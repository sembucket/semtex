This is the distribution kit for Prism, a collection of libraries and
applications for spectral element methods.  To install everything
requires three steps:

1. The environment variable PRISM defines the location of the
installation. It should be added to your .cshrc, and the subdirectory
$PRISM/bin should be added to your path.  

Example:

   setenv PRISM $HOME/Prism
   set path = ($path $PRISM/bin)

If you use a different shell, consult your local system adminstrator
for advice on how to set up your environment correctly.

2. Run the script $PRISM/etc/configure

3. Run the script $PRISM/etc/install

If you're lucky, everything will now be built and installed in
$PRISM/bin.  The most common failure is due to liking graphics
libraries for the application "mscope", which serves as simple
front-end for driving the Navier-Stokes codes.  If this happens try
using "configure -pl nil" to disable all graphics, and install again. 

Once the code is built, try running the script
$PRISM/examples/testsuite.  This will exercise more parts of the
code.  All of the "errors" reported should be small.
