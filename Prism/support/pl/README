Plotting Library

This is a simple plotting library for 2D graphics.  The library is implemented
using GNU libplot.  It provides device-independent graphics on a variety of
"plotters", including X11, postscript, xfig, or anything else directly supported
by libplot.  It also provides output in a variety of bitmap formats by using
the ppm tools for format conversion.

In addition to the low-level graphics provided by libbplot, PL defines routines
for high-level drawing functions, including vector plots, contour plots, axes,
etc.

To link your application you will need additional libraries provided as required by 
libplot.
