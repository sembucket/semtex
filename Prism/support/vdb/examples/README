VDB examples

hello:  This is actually a test of the communications library.  It's
the traditional "hello, world" for a parallel computer.

test:  A command-line program to test the library.

sum: Reads in a mesh of points, performs a direct-stiffness summation
across all processors, and then checks the solution vector on each
processor for errors.

dot: Computes a distributed dot-product of two analytic vectors.  Run
this test on different numbers of processors and make sure you get the 
same result!
