Porting Notes
-------------
12.17.97 Default action for "cf77" is to allow double-precision (128 bit)
variables.  Since most of the fortran bits include double-precision declara-
tions, the compiler should always be called with "-dp" to distable the use
of 128 bit reals.  The C compiler only uses 64 bit reals whether they're
declared as float or double.
