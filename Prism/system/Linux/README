Linux 2.0

Porting Notes
-------------
1.31.98 I did the original port using the GNU C compiler and fort77 to compile
in the BLAS and LAPACK routines.  There is a minor problem with f2c that 
requires a function called MAIN__() to be defined somewhere.  I stuck this in
veclib.c since that's the only library with direct calls to fortran.
