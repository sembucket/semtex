Synopsis
--------
This code is for spectral element solution of (incompressible
Navier--Stokes) time-varying and elliptic PDEs.  Geometries
accommodated are 2D Cartesian or cylindrical, and "2+1/2D", i.e. 2D x
Fourier, again Cartesian or cylindrical.

Distribution
------------
The src directory contains source for the central routines/classes of
spectral/finite element solvers.  Application programs/Makefiles can
be found in upper-level directories:

elliptic  Solve elliptic (Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz) problems.
dns       Navier--Stokes DNS in Cartesian or cylindrical geometries.
utility   Various utility programs.

The code has been tested with (and makefiles support) the following
operating systems: SGI IRIX6.5 (32 & 64-bit), DEC OSF1/Digital Unix,
GNU/Linux (iX86 & alpha), Fujitsu VPP300, NEC SX-4/5, Mac OSX 10.10,
Linux-AMD Opteron x86_64 and Linix-Intel Itanium-2 ia64.

Required
--------
(Gnu) make
C++, C, FORTRAN compilers
bison or yacc
LAPACK and BLAS libraries
(Open) MPI and associated header files

Optional/useful
---------------
Tecplot and/or Paraview
Supermongo

Starting out
------------

Dependencies: cmake, yacc or bison, mpi (optional)

Serial build:
  %> mkdir <build_dir>
  %> cd <build_dir>
  %> cmake ..
  %> make
  %> ctest

Parallel build:
  %> mkdir <build_dir>
  %> cd <build_dir>
  %> cmake .. -DWITH_MPI=ON
  %> make
  %> ctest

Other helpful build flags:
  -DMPI_C_COMPILER=/my/mpi/c/compiler
  -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=/my/mpi/c++/compiler
  -DBLAS_LIBRARIES=/my/blas/library

Files
-----
Semtex uses a base input file which describes the mesh and boundary
conditions.  We call this a "session" file and typically it has no
root extension.  It is written in a format patterned on HTML, which we
have called FEML (for Finite Element Markup Language).  There are a
number of example session files in the mesh directory.  Other files
have standard extensions:

session.num  Global node numbers, produced by enumerate utility.
session.fld  Solution/field file.  Binary format by default.
session.rst  Restart file.  Read in to initialize solution if present.
session.avg  Average file.  Used to store time-mean averages.

After writing a new session file it is best to run meshpr on it before
trying to use it for simulations.  Meshpr will catch most of the
easier-to-make errors.  You can also plot up the results using
SuperMongo or other utility as a visual check.

Utilities
---------
Can be found in the utility directory:

enumerate Generate global node numbering, with RCM optimization.
compare   Generate restart files, compare solutions to a function.
convert   Convert field file formats (IEEE-big/little, ASCII).
meshpr    Generate 2D mesh locations for plotting or checking.
addvort   Add vorticity vector components to a field file.
addfield  Add vorticity, also divergence, helicity, etc.
sem2tec   Convert field files to Amtec TECPLOT format.
project   Convert a field file to a different order interpolation.
interp    Interpolate field file from one 2D mesh to another.
probe     Probe field file at specified points.
noiz      Add a random perturbation to a field file.
calc      An interactive calculator that calls the built-in function parser.
rstress   Compute a Reynolds stresses from a .avg file, subtract averages.

All executables have a -h command line option which gives a help prompt.
