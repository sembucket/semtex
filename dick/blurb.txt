The application of water to land is a key issue in Australian
history. From the early days of European settlement, many saw
irrigation as the way to increase agricultural production and promote
population growth. Irrigation has been one of Australia's speculative
business ventures, with a history of a few successes and many
failures. By the early twentieth century the deficiencies of private
enterprise led governments to take a major role in regulating and
promoting irrigation projects. This book provides a clearly written
and meticulously researched account of the contribution that many
individuals have made to exploring the potential of irrigation in its
first century to 1920.

What is striking is the ingenuity of these pioneers. Not only were
rivers used, but also lakes, springs, sewage and artesian water, and
experiments were made with a variety of different technologies to find
what was suited to particular localities. The main regions covered are
in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia (especially
the Murray River basin), and to a lesser extent Queensland and Western
Australia.

This book makes a useful contribution to the history of Australia's
environment, economy, technology, politics and demography. It will be
of special interest to those studying local history in rural areas.
