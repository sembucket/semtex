\begin{center}\textbf{\undertext{Re: Pioneering Irrigation in Australia}}
\end{center}

I am contacting you to open discussions concerning possible
publication of a book manuscript of the above title. The author was
Gerard (Dick) Blackburn, my father, who completed the manuscript
before he died in 1999.  Dick was a soil scientist who spent most of
his working life researching and publishing at CSIRO Division of Soils
(now CSIRO Land and Water), and through that work developed an
interest in the history of irrigation in Australia.

In order to give you an idea of the coverage, content and style of the
manuscript, I have attached the Table of Contents, the Preface, and
Chapter~1.  I suggest the audience would be people interested in the
history of technology and agriculture in Australia, and it is written
for a general, lay readership.  The increasing level of awareness of
water resource and salinity issues could help make it a timely
offering.

I have the complete manuscript, which runs 180 A4 pages, in my
possession, also in electronic form.  It is indexed.  I can reformat
it, make minor editions (both of which I have already done to put it
into the format attached), and supply camera-ready or electronic
copies.

Would you kindly indicate if you would be interested in publishing it,
or if you would like further information.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
\encl{
Contents, Preface and Chapter 1 of manuscript.
