EXAMPLES (userguide)
====================

The following subdirectories contain material referred to in the Dog
user guide (as of September 2015 - check out the semtex web page):
Steady, Floquet, Transient.


TESTCASES (additional)
======================

The testcases in various subdirectories here exercise various
different parts the stability analysis code dog. For cases with
steady base flows, the full base flow file is provided, while for
cases with time-periodic base flows, a restart file is provided with
which to regenerate the base flow. Shell scripts are/will be provided
for re-running the test cases.

STEADY FLOWS
============

chan2D
------

Steady 2D Poiseuille channel flow at Re=7500 is 2D unstable to (2D)
TS waves.  This case is documented in Canuto et al., 1988,
p19--25. The base flow is steady and 2C/2D; the perturbation is
unsteady and 2C/2D also.

These are the results of running

dog -k 16 -n 1 -m 500 -t 1e-6 chan3

-- Iteration = 260, H(k+1, k) = 0.893587
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.0022e+00  2.4989e-01  2.2356e-03  2.4989e-01  9.4531e-07
 1  1.0022e+00 -2.4989e-01  2.2356e-03 -2.4989e-01  9.4531e-07

The corresponding case in Canuto et al. suggests 2.23497e-3 and
2.4989154e-1 for Growth and Frequency parameters respectively.

swirl2D
-------

The steady flow in a lid-driven cavity has a number of axisymmetric
modes, as described in

Lopez, Marques & Sanchez (2001), Oscillatory modes in an enclosed
swirling flow, JFM 439: 109-129.

At Re=4000, the period of the leading mode is predicted by Lopez et al
to be (page 16) 4000*0.007175=28.3.

The steady base flow for this example was pre-computed using a Newton method, as described in Blackburn (2002) Three-dimensional instability and state selection in an oscillatory axisymmetric swirling flow, PF 14: 3983–3996.

Here is the result of running

dog -k 8 -n 1 -m 200 vb2

-- Iteration = 113, H(k+1, k) = 0.167605
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.1831e+00  3.0637e+00  1.2178e-02  2.2185e-01  1.0826e-06
 1  1.1831e+00 -3.0637e+00  1.2178e-02 -2.2185e-01  1.0826e-06
 2  1.1244e+00  1.6671e+00  8.4916e-03  1.2072e-01  2.0046e-05
 3  1.1244e+00 -1.6671e+00  8.4916e-03 -1.2072e-01  2.0046e-05
 4  1.0892e+00  2.5318e+00  6.1865e-03  1.8333e-01  1.1001e-03
 5  1.0892e+00 -2.5318e+00  6.1865e-03 -1.8333e-01  1.1001e-03
 6  1.0322e+00  1.9051e+00  2.2955e-03  1.3795e-01  1.0948e-01
 7  1.0322e+00 -1.9051e+00  2.2955e-03 -1.3795e-01  1.0948e-01
dog: converged, writing 1 eigenvectors.

The period of the leading mode is TWOPI/0.22185=23.322.

(Which suggests their analysis may possibly be in error, although the values
are in the same ballpark.  Another possibility is that our estimate for the steady base flow is not sufficiently resolved/converged.)

backstep3D
----------

Steady 2D backward-facing step flow (2C/2D) is first unstable with
increasing Re to a steady 3C/3D instability. 

Barkley, Gomes & Henderson (2002), Three-dimensional instability in
flow over a backward-facing step, JFM 473: 167-190.

At a Re=750 the neutrally stable eigenvalue is real; here are the
results of running

dog -k 25 -n 1 -m 500 -t 1e-6 back

-- Iteration = 332, H(k+1, k) = 0.888106
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.0009e+00  0.0000e+00  4.2587e-04  0.0000e+00  9.9989e-07
 1  9.7470e-01  0.0000e+00 -1.2813e-02  0.0000e+00  5.1583e-04

...
dog: converged, writing 1 eigenvectors.

stenosis3D
----------

Steady axisymmetric flow in a cylindrical stenosis has an
unstable 3D mode, k = 1, which becomes unstable at Re=722 (Sherwin & Blackburn, JFM 533).

For Re=500 these are the results of running

dog -k 8 -n 1 -m 100 -t 1e-8 Sten50_Cyl

-- Iteration = 72, H(k+1, k) = 0.391199
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  9.7378e-01  0.0000e+00 -5.3146e-02  0.0000e+00  5.1412e-09
 1  7.6398e-01  1.6488e-01 -5.3843e-01  3.2977e-01  5.8337e-04
 2  7.6398e-01 -1.6488e-01 -5.3843e-01 -3.2977e-01  5.8337e-04
 3  5.0686e-01  6.3929e-01 -1.3590e+00  1.2786e+00  2.7320e-02
 4  5.0686e-01 -6.3929e-01 -1.3590e+00 -1.2786e+00  2.7320e-02
 5  7.2613e-01  1.7025e+00 -6.4005e-01  3.4051e+00  5.0946e-02
 6  7.2613e-01 -1.7025e+00 -6.4005e-01 -3.4051e+00  5.0946e-02
 7  4.1284e-01  0.0000e+00 -1.7694e+00  0.0000e+00  8.3031e-02
dog: converged, writing 1 eigenvectors.

The domain size and resolution used in this example are both smaller and lower than that in the article cited above.  The growth rate is however very close to the value for Re=500 and k=1 seen in (inset to) figure 5 there.

PERIODIC FLOWS
==============

cylinder3D
----------

The circular cylinder at Re=220 has a 2C/2D time-periodic wake that is
unstable to a 3C/3D synchronous "mode A" instability.

Barkley & Henderson (1996), Three-dimensional Floquet stability
analysis of the wake of a circular cylinder, JFM 322: 215-241.

These are the results (after 16 cycles) of running

dog -k 12 -n 1 -m 40 -t 1e-6 m32

-- Iteration = 16, H(k+1, k) = 0.61409
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.2674e+00  0.0000e+00  4.7754e-02  0.0000e+00  1.6512e-03
 1  3.4486e-01  0.0000e+00 -2.1456e-01  0.0000e+00  6.8124e-02
 2  4.1256e-01  1.2434e+00 -1.7843e-01  2.5059e-01  1.0291e-01
 3  4.1256e-01 -1.2434e+00 -1.7843e-01 -2.5059e-01  1.0291e-01

The residual actually fails to get much lower for this analysis.

cavityTW
--------

The 2:1 rectangular driven cavity is a 2C/2D time-periodic flow that
at St=100, Re=1212 has quasi-periodic 3C/3D SW/TW instabilities.

Blackburn & Lopez (2003), The onset of three-dimensional standing
and modulated travelling waves in a periodically driven cavity flow,
JFM 497.

These are the results of running (for N_Z=1 or 2)

dog -k 13 -m 40 -n 2 -t 1e-6 cav01

-- Iteration = 14, H(k+1, k) = 0.0653317
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  9.9854e-01  1.5277e+00 -1.2044e-04  1.2605e-01  1.9949e-07
 1  9.9854e-01 -1.5277e+00 -1.2044e-04 -1.2605e-01  1.9949e-07
 2  9.3304e-01  1.3784e+00 -5.7183e-03  1.1373e-01  2.1672e-07
 3  9.3304e-01 -1.3784e+00 -5.7183e-03 -1.1373e-01  2.1672e-07

(In this case, the second mode has the lower residual for quite a
number of iterations.)

swirl3D
-------

The 2:1 cylindrical driven cavity at Re=4000 is an axisymmetric 3C/2D
time-periodic flow that has 3C/3D MRW instabilities.  Below we have
the outcome for azimuthal wavenumber BETA = 6.

Blackburn (2002), Three-dimensional instability and state selection in
an oscillatory axisymmetric swirling flow, Phys. Fluids V14N11:
3983-96.

These are the results of running

TRANSIENT GROWTH

The analytical solution for the base flow is given by
