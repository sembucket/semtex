This is the Barkley--Henderson test case for Floquet stability of flow
past a circular cylinder.  At Re=220, the leading Floquet multiplier
is 1.2671 when BETA=1.7 (wavelength=3.696D). This result was obtained
with a Krylov dimension of 12 (residual about 10^-11).

In order to generate a base flow, run dns m32_2D; cp m32_2D.fld
m32.bse.  Then run the Floquet solver.  The base flow has a period of
4.96192.
