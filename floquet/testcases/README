ARNOLDI TESTCASES
=================

The testcases in various subdirectories here exercise various
different parts the stability analysis code arnoldi. For cases with
steady base flows, the full base flow file is provided, while for
cases with time-periodic base flows, a restart file is provided with
which to regenerate the base flow. Shell scripts are/will be provided
for re-running the test cases.

STEADY FLOWS
============

chan2D 
------

Steady 2D Poiseuille channel flow at Re=7500 is 2D unstable to (2D)
TS waves.  This case is documented in Canuto et al., 1988,
p19--25. The base flow is steady and 2C/2D; the perturbation is
unsteady and 2C/2D also.

These are the results of running

arnoldi -k 16 -n 1 -m 500 -t 1e-6 chan3

-- Iteration = 260, H(k+1, k) = 0.893587
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.0022e+00  2.4989e-01  2.2356e-03  2.4989e-01  9.4531e-07
 1  1.0022e+00 -2.4989e-01  2.2356e-03 -2.4989e-01  9.4531e-07

The corresponding case in Canuto et al suggests 2.23497e-3 and
2.4989154e-1 for Growth and Frequency parameters respectively.

backstep3D
----------

Steady 2D backward-facing step flow (2C/2D) is first unstable with
increasing Re to a steady 3C/3D instability. 

Barkley, D., Gomes, M.G.M. & Henderson, R.D. Three-dimensional
instability in flow over a backward-facing step, JFM 473, 2002,
167--190.

At a Re=750 the neutrally stable eigenvalue is real; here are the
results of running

arnoldi -k 25 -n 1 -m 500 -t 1e-6 back

-- Iteration = 341, H(k+1, k) = 1.01155
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.0009e+00  0.0000e+00  4.2741e-04  0.0000e+00  9.8438e-07
 1  9.7473e-01  0.0000e+00 -1.2796e-02  0.0000e+00  6.5157e-04
 2  9.7233e-01  6.3984e-02 -1.4031e-02  3.1992e-02  9.7631e-04
 3  9.7233e-01 -6.3984e-02 -1.4031e-02 -3.1992e-02  9.7631e-04

stenosis3D
----------

Steady axisymmetric flow in a cylindrical stenosis has a (nearly)
unstable 3D mode, k = 1.

These are the results of running

arnoldi -k 8 -n 1 -m 100 -t 1e-8 Sten50_Cyl

-- Iteration = 71, H(k+1, k) = 0.33239
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  9.7380e-01  0.0000e+00 -5.3100e-02  0.0000e+00  6.1002e-09
 1  7.6417e-01  1.6542e-01 -5.3793e-01  3.3085e-01  7.9937e-04

PERIODIC FLOWS
==============

cylinder3D
----------

The circular cylinder at Re=220 has a 2C/2D time-periodic wake that is
unstable to a 3C/3D synchronous "mode A" instability.

Barkley D. & Henderson R. D. Three-dimensional Floquet stability
analysis of the wake of a circular cylinder, JFM 322, 1996, 215--241.

These are the results (after 16 cycles) of running

arnoldi -k 12 -n 1 -m 40 -t 1e-6 m32

-- Iteration = 16, H(k+1, k) = 0.604068
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.2671e+00  0.0000e+00  4.7706e-02  0.0000e+00  2.1695e-03
 1  2.4151e-01  0.0000e+00 -2.8635e-01  0.0000e+00  9.5977e-02


cavityTW
--------

The 2:1 rectangular driven cavity is a 2C/2D time-periodic flow that
at St=100, Re=1212 has quasi-periodic 3C/3D SW/TW instabilities.

Blackburn H.M. & Lopez, J.M., The onset of three-dimensional standing
and modulated travelling waves in a periodically driven cavity flow,
JFM (submitted), 2003.

These are the results of running (for N_Z=1 or 2)

arnoldi -k 13 -m 40 -n 2 -t 1e-6 cav01

-- Iteration = 14, H(k+1, k) = 0.0653328
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  9.9857e-01  1.5277e+00 -1.1795e-04  1.2605e-01  1.9949e-07
 1  9.9857e-01 -1.5277e+00 -1.1795e-04 -1.2605e-01  1.9949e-07
 2  9.3307e-01  1.3784e+00 -5.7158e-03  1.1373e-01  2.1672e-07
 3  9.3307e-01 -1.3784e+00 -5.7158e-03 -1.1373e-01  2.1672e-07

(In this case, the second mode has the lower residual for quite a
number of iterations.)

swirl3D
-------

The 2:1 cylindrical driven cavity at Re=4000 is an axisymmetric 3C/2D
time-periodic flow that has 3C/3D MRW instabilities.

an oscillatory axisymmetric swirling flow, Phys. Fluids V14N11, 2002,
3983--3996.

These are the results of running

arnoldi -k 13 -m 40 -n 1 -t 1e-6 vb2

-- Iteration = 12, H(k+1, k) = 0.222227
EV  Magnitude   Angle       Growth      Frequency   Residual
 0  1.4651e+00  2.3637e+00  1.3503e-02  8.3576e-02  2.2363e-07
