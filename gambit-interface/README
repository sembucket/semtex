(0) Make sure that you have installed a Fortran95 compliant compiler, e.g. G95.
(1) Change to the source directory
      > cd src
    and adjust GNUmakefile such that FC contains the path to the compiler, and
    FPOTS provides appropriate options. In particular, it should be considered
    that the sources are given in free form. For example
      FC = g95
      FOPTS = -ffree-form
    should work with the free G95 compiler, and
      FC = ifort
      FOPTS = -FR
    with the Intel compiler.
(2) Clean up and build the converter:
      > make tidy
      > make

To try the example follow the instructions given in the userguide (doc/ug.pdf).
