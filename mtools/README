Summary of executables in mtools:

1. qmesh
--------

Qmesh builds a quad mesh from a description of loop boundary nodes. It
generates a FEML-like file of NODES and ELEMENTS.  The NODES have no
status information.

2. outline
----------

Outline is a utility to generate a list of loop boundary nodes for
input to qmesh from a condensed description (loops, arcs, etc).

3. merge
--------

Take 2 FEML-like files (with NODE status information) and generate a
merged mesh.  Apply Laplacian smoothing.

4. smooth
---------

Take a FEML-like file (with NODE status information) and apply
Laplacian smoothing.  Currently out-of-date, and potentially redundant
(the functions are already in merge).

5. reflect
----------

Take a FEML-like file and generate a new mesh by reflection in x or y
axes.
