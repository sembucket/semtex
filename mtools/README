Summary of executables in mtools:

1. qmesh
--------

Qmesh builds a quad mesh from a description of loop boundary nodes. It
generates a FEML-like file of NODES and ELEMENTS.  The NODES have no
status information.  General methodology comes from [1].

2. outline
----------

Outline is a utility to generate a list of loop boundary nodes for
input to qmesh from a condensed description (loops, arcs, etc).

3. merge
--------

Take 2 FEML-like files (with additional NODE status information) and
generate a merged mesh.  If only a single file is given then the
merging step is ignored.  Apply Laplacian smoothing to the final mesh.

4. reflect
----------

Take a FEML-like file and generate a new mesh by reflection in x or y
axes. Combine the result (outcome has double the number of elements
but typically less than double the number of nodes).

5. unique
---------

Fix a list of nodes and elements produced e.g. by mesh digitisation
(e.g. by digmesh, Murray's code), where the vertices may lack
uniqueness. Fixing makes the vertices unique within a specfied
tolerance.
