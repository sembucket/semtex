Is the material new, or does it re-present information already
published in archival form, especially by the same authors?

If new in detail, is the information readily derivable or obvious from
prior knowledge or publications?

Is the material interesting and useful?  It may be new but not
interesting enough to justify publication.

Is there sufficient new information to justify publication in the form
suggested (for example, is a technical note or letter more appropriate
than a full length article)?

Is the area of discourse relevant to the journal?

Is the sectioning and layout appropriate, and does material appear in
the appropriate sections? Is the title a succinct guide to the
content?

Results sections should generally concentrate on presenting original
results, while comparison to published results or theory is generally
contained in a discussion section.

Is the manuscript an appropriate length, or could it be shortened?

As much quantitative information as possible should be presented in
dimensionless form, and the normalisation supplied.

All graph axes should be labelled and given numeric tags.  Graphs must
be clear and legible at the size they will appear in print.

Is prior publication adequately acknowledged?

References should be presented in the form of the journal, but in
general it should be possible to find and check any information
referred to using the information supplied.

Lengthy derivations should be relegated to appendices.  Derivations
and numerical values should be correct and internally consistent
through different parts of the paper (e.g. text and captions).

Is the treatment too phenomenological or descriptive? A good manuscript
should interpret results within a theoretical context.

All figures and tables should be discussed in the text. If they are
not, they can be omitted without loss.
