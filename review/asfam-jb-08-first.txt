REVIEW:	      First

This short manuscript presents an analytically based method for the
identification of the axial location of an occulsion in a straight
distensible tube based on two measurements of pipe centreline
velocity, or alternatively pipe radius, at different axial locations
upstream of the blockage, when the inflow is time-periodic and flows
are laminar.  The theory is developed for a completely blocked pipe
but is said to be applicable also for cases where the stenosis is
severe, based on its reflection coefficient. While it is said that the
identification can be made using measurements of tube radius, the
treatment is developed almost exclusively for the case of measurements
of centreline velocity.

I beleive the manuscript should be rejected, for a number of
mainly practical reasons:

1. Chief among these is the practical point that the measurements have
to be obtained on one side (upstream) of a blockage, which implies
that the location of the blockage is already known fairly well.

2. The method is said to be applicable only to severely occluded
arteries.  However, it is my understanding that ultrasound techniques
can already be used to visually identify these cases non-intrusively.

3. The theoretical development is made mainly for the case where pipe
centreline velocities are measured, however this will be difficult to
do precisely and the velocity profiles are non-trivial. It is not at
all clear how the method might work based on measurements of bulk
velocity or for a curved tube, as would be encountered in practice.
