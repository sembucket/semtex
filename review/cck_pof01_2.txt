SUMMARY
-------

The revised manuscript still does not cover a substantial amount of
new material, and as such is still of marginal interest -- I'm afraid
the revisions have not helped to change my opinion here.  The authors
have in the main responded adequately to the points I raised in the
first review.  New material related to higher Reynolds number results
(Re=1000) has been included, and I am concerned about the spatial
resolution of these simulations, and what new information they reveal.

1. Spatial resolution at Re=1000.  The majority of the results
   presented are Re=100.  In order to allow some comparative
   assessment of Reynolds number effects, the authors now supply some
   Re=1000 results, e.g. Figs 4 and 14.  While these do provide an
   interesting point of comparison, I would be very surprised if the
   Re=1000 results are adequately converged; if a 241x241 grid is
   adequate at Re=100, one might expect say 750x750 is required at
   Re=1000 (using laminar BL scaling), rather than the 301x301 grid
   the authors have used.  The authors need to demonstrate the spatial
   convergence of these new results as well (or revise downwards their
   estimate of the Reynolds number they represent).

2. In discussing Reynolds number effects, at the bottom of p.8 and top
   of p.9, it was not clear if the authors were or were not asserting
   that their results at Re=1000 agree with the predictions of
   Tokumaru and Dimotakis.  They should amend the last sentence of p.8
   to state if the Re=1000 results agree with TD91.
