TITLE:        Numerical simulations of vortex-induced vibration of a
              circular cylinder with low mass-damping

REVIEW:	      First


SUBJECT MATERIAL
----------------

The title adequately introduces the subject material. The simulations
are two-dimensional, and employ a two-equation turbulence model
(Menter's version of the k-w) model, in conjunction with a finite
volume discretisation.

MAIN POINTS
-----------

There are three main points which in my opinion the authors need to
address in a possible revision.

MINOR POINTS
------------
