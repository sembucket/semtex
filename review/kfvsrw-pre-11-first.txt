SUBJECT MATERIAL

A study of slow and steady flow through a symmetric 2D constriction in
a channel. As the title states, both numerical (LBM) and experimental
(particle tracking). The maximum Reynolds number is 100.

RECOMMENDATION

The methodology of the study seems appropriate and the work has been
carried out with care. Experimental and numerical results are in good
agreement. However, I could not recommend publication of this work as
a stand-alone study in fluid mechanics, since no novel phenomena are
uncovered, and the behaviour is much as one would expect for a highly
viscous flow. One could predict the general behaviour after reading
any good text in viscous fluid dynamics, while the details and
numerical values (admittedly studied with care and in some depth) are
particular to the geometry considered and hence lack generality.  The
study could fit well within a larger body of work, say one that dealt
with the physiology/biochemistry/cellular dynamics of blood clotting
or atherogenesis, but is not viable on its own.
