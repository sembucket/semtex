              tangent operator for flow past a circular cylinder

REVIEW:	      Third

I am prepared to accept the manuscript now. But I still have some
suggestions which I hope may help the authors to improve their
manuscript:

1. I think the manuscript could be improved by some more attention to
   discussion of the shape of the global spectrum and possible
   numerical effects. For example, it seems likely that the
   complex-conjugate "outlier" eigenvalues with real parts in the
   range 100-200 are probably numerical artifacts. It would do no harm
   to acknowledge this.

2. The fact that the onset Reynolds and Strouhal numbers do not agree
   particularly well with past studies (as if there were any
   consensus!) is probably associated with the comparatively small
   size of the computational domain. This especially would tend to
   push the Strouhal number up, and indeed it is the highest of the
   quoted values. Again, I don't believe it would do any harm to
   discuss this a little.

MINOR POINTS, mostly of English usage:

3. In the abstract and also in the acknowledgements, the authors call
   their method "solenoidal free" where I think they probably mean
   "divergence free".

4. In the introduction, "finite divergence-free element" ->
   "divergence-free finite element".

5. In the introduction "obtained projecting" -> "obtained by
   projecting".

6. In the introduction, quoting from Jackson, I doubt the last
   sentence "This reduced a factor of about eight." is a direct or
   correct quotation. Please check.

7. In the introduction, "stability linear problem" -> "linear
   stability problem".

8. Page 14: "of spectrums of wake flows" -> "of wake flow spectra".
