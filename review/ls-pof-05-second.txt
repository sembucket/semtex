There are still some points to be cleared up.

1. On page 9, para. 2, the authors state "... have shown that the AR=1
case we study herein lies exactly at the interface ...".  It does not
lie exactly at the interface, but close to it; the text should be
changed.

2. The authors apparently did not understand my point about a
requirement for radial weighting of the measure expressed by equation
(2). I should have put this better: as they stand, both measures (2)
and (3) are biased estimates respectively of the variance and mean
concentration because they do not account for the variation in control
volumes from point to point in the mesh. Specifically it appears that
as the mesh is uniform in (r,z), the size of control volumes varies
linearly with radius. Either each measure should be recomputed to
account for these non-uniform control volumes, or the text should
state that the measures are biased estimates.
