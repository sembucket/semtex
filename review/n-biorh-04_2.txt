TITLE:        Comparison of blood rheological models for physiological
              flow simulation

REVIEW:	      Second

1. With the author's response to the first review, I better understand
the reasons for working with the same set of boundary conditions but
varying rheology, as opposed to a more general study.  I think it
would help the reader if the logic were made explicit in the
Introduction.

2. In the material introduced on p.13, the author states that "eddy
generation is essentially inviscid" (I think instead he means
"vorticity generation").  This may be true, but that doesn't mean that
changing the wall viscosity has no influence, because there can be a
secondary effect through pressure gradient terms.  I suggest there are
some more subtleties to be considered here (including generation and
anihiliation of vorticity at walls, as well as diffusion in the
fluid).  A reference the author could consider here is Morton (1984),
"The generation and decay of vorticity", Geophys Astrophys Fluid Dyn
V28, 277--308.

3. P.13, following definition of vorticity, "intended" should be
"indented".

4. Figure 3 lacks an abscissa label.
