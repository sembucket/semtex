REVIEW:	      First

The manuscript describes an investigation of time-average forces on
nominally two-dimensional cylinders with (a) stranded and (b)
ice-acretion type leading-edge build-up and (c) D-type
cross-sections. Both experiments and 2D numerical simulations are
employed. Reynolds numbers are of the order 10,000.

Unfortunately, I do not believe there is sufficient new material here
to justify publication. The most extensive set of data (Figure 10)
gived Cd for the D-section cylinder, the forces on which surely have
been adequately dealt with by now. The only other set of data which
presents forces is shown in Figure 11. 

Further, the grid resolutions quoted for the numerical simulations are
extremely low (and the simulations are 2D). In order to justify the
mesh resultion, mean coefficients of drag for a circular cylinder are
compared with experimental values. Admittedly the agreement is good,
but I suspect this agreement would not carry over to other
coefficients such as Cl, Strouhal number, etc. Given the low
resolution, these checks also need to be made.

The manuscript is well written and gets the authors' points across
clearly. However, it needs very substantial additions of new and
adequately validated material before it could be considered for
publication.
