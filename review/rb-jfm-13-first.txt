SUBJECT MATERIAL

Theoretical treatment of non-trivial flow kinematics.


RECOMMENDATION

The manuscript is heavy on theoretical concepts and rather too light
on explicatory diagrams and examples.  Having said that, the text is
well written, not hard to follow, and is interesting enough to read,
as far as it goes.  Essentially we are guided through a sequence of
theoretical manipulations of various quantities derived from
kinematics of velocity fields but without enough guidance on why these
concepts are useful --- how they may be used to say something useful
about general flows. The material is certainly suitable for JFM and I
would support publication if the manuscript could be extended to cover
motivational aspects to a greater degree, however as it stands I could
not do so.

SUGGESTIONS/QUESTIONS

1. The authors need to highlight their original contribution and what
their work enables one to deduce about fluid flows and that previous
offerings do not.

2. The work on dynamics of Lamb vector divergence by Hamman et
al. (2008) focusses much more strongly on applications, and it is that
kind of emphasis that I would like to see given here.  For example,
the illustration here in section 9 concentrates on what one can
observe about the quantities considered in the manuscript in a rather
specialised flow, but would not help to motivate me to examine another
flow using the concepts advanced by the authors.
