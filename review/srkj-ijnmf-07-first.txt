SUBJECT MATERIAL

OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Owing to a number of apparent difficulties with the reported results I
cannot recommend publication.

POINTS

1. The boundary conditions are not, as far as I could see, reported
for the problem studied. However, from an examination of Figures 1 and
5 it appears that, since there is a fairly thick boundary layer on the
wall, the wall moves at the same speed as the airfoil. This is
contrary to what happens when a wing passes a stationary boundary,
since the wall is fixed relative to the free stream. Thus I don't
necessarily see this as a study of wing-in-ground effect. The authors
need to clear up what they have done here, and if it is true that the
wall is fixed relative to the airfoil, I think they need to re-do the
calculations. On the other hand, if the wall is fixed relative to the
free-stream, then at some point upstream of the LE the wall boundary
layer should become negligibly thin at the reported Reynolds numbers.

2. Resolution study.

3. L/D

4. FFT

5. CMLE
