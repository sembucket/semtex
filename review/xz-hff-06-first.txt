SUBJECT MATTER

A numerical simulation of axisymmetric flow in a linearly tapering
tube with two stenoses of circular arc section. The simulation is
carried out using a commercial package, URANS, and a two-equation
turbulence model with adjustments for low Reynolds numbers.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT

This manuscript is not suitable for publication.

REASONS

1. The motivation for the work is poorly explained. Why pick this
specific geometry, other than to conduct a simulation?

2. There is no attempt to describe or justify the dimensionless groups
that describe the flow. All the results are given in dimensional form.

3. There is little justification for using URANS in this problem,
other than to say that others have done so. Without knowing the
Reynolds numbers, etc, of the prsent flow it is virtually impossible
to assess if this might be reasonable or not.

4. There is no assessment of convergence of the simulaton results,
either by adjusting the timestep, or the mesh resolution. I should say
that to do a good job of simulating this flow either with or without a
turbulence model, there would need to be more resolution near the
walls, for example. I doubt also that a first-order upwind treatment
of the advective terms is adequate.

5. Fully three pages of the manuscript is taken up with describing the
turbulence model. No references are given, and one suspects this
material could have come from the Fluent documentation, or from
Wilcox's book.

6. The inlet flow (equation 11) is not a solution for pulsatile flow
in a straight tube, and does not even have a radial profile of any
kind.
