REVIEW:	      First

The manuscript describes a 2D numerical investigation of flow past and
forces on a cylinder forced to oscillate transversely to the flow at
Re=185. The Reynolds number has been chosen to match the lowest in
experiments of Gu et al. (1994). Two previous numerical papers have
dealt with the flow at the same Reynolds number: Lu & Dalton (1996)
and Guilmineau & Queutey (2002) (as the present authors point out).

At the end of the Introduction the authors state: "As reviewed above,
each effect of the amplitude and frequency of oscillation on the flow
has been quite well established by numerous researches, resulting in
greatly improving the understanding of the flow characteristics. Thus,
this study aims at providing the detail quantitative information about
the flow variables such as the lift and drag coefficients, shedding
frequency, and wall vorticity distributions on the cylinder in the
wide range of amplitude and frequency of the oscillation."

In brief, the authors offer us only very limited motivation for their
work and to interest the reader. When the frequency ratio of forcing
leaves the lock-in range, the forces on the cylinder become
quasiperiodic, a result that is now well known. The discussion of the
results is almost purely descriptive of what can be observed in the
figures and offers almost no insight into the flow physics. Finally,
as the Reynolds number is so low, the flow is of little technological
importance for the typical reader of Ocean Engineering.

I'm afraid I have to recommend that the manuscript should be rejected.
