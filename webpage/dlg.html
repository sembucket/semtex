<h1>DLG &mdash; Discus Launch Glider</h1>

The discus launch glider is a recent variant of the radio-controlled
hand launch glider. The model is tossed into the air with a technique
that is somewhere between an athletic hammer throw and a discus throw;
the model is grasped by a launch peg on one wingtip and the pilot gets
the model airborne with a running pirouette throw. (DL is also
sometimes referred to as SAL, for Side-Arm-Launch.) Launch heights of
approximately 40m can be achieved, with dead-air flight durations of
order 90s. Models in the FIA's F3K competition category have a maximum
wingspan of 1.5m, and typically weight 300&ndash;350gm ready to
fly. As with any flat-land gliding, the principal objective is to
maximize flight times by catching thermals.

In addition to competition flying, this mode of radio-controlled
sailplane activity is ideally suited to small-field sport flying, as
the models are silent and there is minimal interference with other
users of park space, but performance can be amazingly good. In part,
this surely accounts for the recent boom in popularity of DLG. After a
long layoff from free-flight modelling since the 1970s and 1980s, I
decided to give DLG a try and I love it. I would say it is definitely
not a beginner's category, but I found a course of self-training with
a 2-channel foam flying wing, and then a 2m 4-channel sailplane, both
from hi-start launches, was sufficient to give me confidence with
using RC for the first time before progressing to DLG.

<h3>Model design</h3>

There a great many DLGs on the market if you don't feel like building
your own, and quality at the top end of the market is high; models are
expensive for their weight but the expense is much lower than for a
larger competition-class composite glider.  Typically, kits come with
the fuselage and wings finished (although you may have to join wing
halves together), while the tail surfaces may, or may not, be
finished. Most modern models use composite construction of one sort or
another; tail booms are universally carbon-fibre tubes, and carbon
fibre is also usually used as wing-spar material. The two primary
sources of models are Eastern Europe, and North America. As a broad
generalisation, the best European models typically use moulded wings
laid up in CNC-machined moulds, with glass-fibre/balsa/glass-fibre
sandwich wing skins and internal carbon-fibre spars, while the best
American models typically use hot-wire cut foamed plastics wing cores
surrounded with vacuum-bagged aramid (Kevlar) wing skins, again with
carbon-fibre spars. At the time of writing (late 2005), European
models are somewhat cheaper, but the bagged models have wing loadings
that are lower by of order 20%.

<p>

Models typically have fairly large vertical tail volume coefficients
to maximize yaw damping at launch (to damp out yaw rotation following
release), fairly small amounts of dihedral and vertical fins with
quite a bit of sub-fuselage area in order to minimize yaw-roll
coupling. The majority of modern DLG models are based around Mark
Drela's airfoils that have been designed with his XFOIL program for
model Reynolds numbers. This is a hybrid 2D analysis that uses a panel
method to calculate inviscid (infinite Reynolds number) flow around a
given airfoil shape, then a boundary layer solution to calculate the
boundary layer displacement thickness at the given <i>Re</i> (thus
giving a new shape), iterating through the panel method again, then
the boundary-layer solution, and so forth until the answer is
satisfactorily converged.  These airfoils are typically designed for
small camber changes with large flaps to allow high lift/drag for
cruise with maximum distance covered per unit drop when the flaps are
up for flying through sinking air, but which will give maximum
duration (lowest rate of sink per unit time) for thermal soaring when
they are slightly lowered.

<h3>Trimming</h3>

If you have flown and trimmed a free-flight hand launch glider you
won't have too much difficulty with the basics of setting up a
DLG. The CG position should be as far aft as possible consistent with
achieving a little longitudinal stability. This is for two main
reasons: too far forward and (a) (once trimmed for a stable glide) you
will have too great a static stability margin; the model will not
respond in a lively way to up- and down-drafts, which is an essential
visual indicator of thermal activity; (b) the model will tend to loop
during launch. Of course, the CG needs to be far enough forward for
the model to have positive static longitudinal stability.  As with
free-flight hand launch gliders, a smooth transition from climb to
glide is critical achieving good duration, but with RC models this is
best achieved through an explicit down-elevator-command bunt off the
top of the climb, rather than through autonomous flight with other
trimming.

<p>

Models should also be balanced laterally so they will glide straight
in thermal-search mode with minimal trim inputs &mdash; trim inputs create
drag.

<p>

Thermalling turn trim is much the same as for a free-flight
model. After initiation with aileron deflection, turn is held with a
slight rudder deflection to prevent adverse yaw and up-elevator to fly
at higher <i>C<sub>l</sub></i> required in banked flight. Slight
adverse aileron deflection is then used to compensate for the inner
wing generating less lift owing to its lower speed in circular flight,
preventing a spiral dive.

<h3>Model preparation and building</h3>

Since the discus launch imposes a fair amount of stress on the
airframe, models must be strong, and control runs must have no slop
and minimal flexibility. In my opinion, it is worth adding a little
weight strengthening a model when you are assembling it rather than
having to fix a broken model later on. It is worth checking all the
online material you can find about your model to identify design flaws
and fix potential problems in advance. Carbon fibre is an amazing
material and can be used to add a lot of strength and stiffness for
minimal weight gain.

<p>

It is worth taking care to build the model as straight as possible,
again so the model will launch and glide straight with minimal trim
inputs.

<h3>Radio</h3>

Most of the current models are 4-channel (rudder, elevator, ailerons
and flaps) but you really need at least a 6-channel programmable
transmitter to fly these models. What to do with the two `spare'
channels? They're used to drive slaved control inputs and trim
settings. For example, I use a JR X2610 6-channel transmitter set up
in mode 2, with ailerons and elevator on the right stick, rudder and
throttle on the left stick. This transmitter has 4 programmable mixes,
in addition to built-in aileron&ndash;rudder and elevator&ndash;flap
mixes. Throttle is obviously redundant on a glider, but I slave
(full-deflection) flaps and elevator to this channel to be able to
slow the model down at landing &mdash; a small amount of down elevator
is coupled in to counteract the effective increase in decalage
introduced by full flap deflection (so that accounts for 2 of the
available 4 programmable mixes). The 2-position flap switch is then
used to drive camber change: slight negative flap deflection for
launch and high L/D, slight positive for minimum sink and
thermalling. This is set up on the left switch. The landing gear,
another redundant control, is used to drive slaved elevator and rudder
trim settings as may be required for launch (thus accounting for the
remaining 2 programmable mixes); gear is on the right 2-position
switch.

<p>
With more sophisticated transmitters, more involved setups are
possible (perhaps inevitable!).

<p>

Make sure you buy good quality servos; typically they will weigh in
the range 5&ndash;9gm each; it is worth paying more for good
servos. Criteria to look for in decreasing order of importance
(depending a little on the specific control) are: good centering,
holding power, and torque. For ailerons, good centering is important,
since flap areas are typically large, while for rudder, holding power
is important as fin side-loads are high during launch. Speed is not so
critical. With modern thin airfoil sections, wing-mounted servos
typically need to be less than 10mm thick. JR servos have a good
all-round reputation, but the thinnest currently available is 11mm.

<h3>Fitness</h3>

You don't have to be extremely fit to fly DLG, but you probably want
to be moderately so, beforehand. Most of the launch effort comes from
torso, back and upper thigh muscles. Shoulder muscles get used
somewhat less. Overall, the amount of shoulder strain is much lower
compared to older (javelin) style hand launch. You can expect a bit of
soreness for your first few flying sessions, but this will gradually go
away (faster if you are younger!).

<p>

In the following I will discuss a few models that I have built. 

<h2>Highlight</h2>

A popular moulded-wing model produced by Nikolay Nikolov
(Bulgaria). The Highlight is also known as the Radina in Japan, as the
Enigma in North America, and as the Discus 150 in France. The design
does not use Drela-based airfoils (not that these are necessarily the
last word in airfoil design, of course) and is consequently possibly
getting a little long in the tooth &mdash; there are rumours of an
update. On the other hand, it is still very good, with a great
straight launch. The model also represents comparatively good value
for money. Construction quality is excellent and the design has been
in production long enough for most of the bugs to be either elminated
or well-known. The wing in particular is very nicely made and finished
and is reputedly very robust. The ailerons taper to points near the
wing-tips (so the wing TE is continuous), which seems a reasonable
idea from an aerodynamic viewpoint, but partly as a consequence of
this the wing servos require comparatively high torque capacity.

<p>

Most Highlights are set up with all 4 servos installed in the nose
pod; this is definitely a good idea in part because the nose is
comparatively short and so the servos also serve as
nose-weight. Battery packs can be made from 4x 2/3-AAA cells, located
in front of the servo tray. My model came in at 300gm/10.6oz AUW with
a few grams of nose-weight.

<h3>Known weak spots</h3>

<ul>
<li> Pod &mdash; it is common to reinforce the whole pod with some
unidirectional carbon running from below the wing to the nose, and to
use a servo tray epoxied inside the nose for strength. I also laid
some 95gm Kevlar around the wing saddle internally, and some more
external carbon cloth around the slots cut for the aileron
pushrods. Tape the slide-on nose sheath in position for added
strength.  <li> Pod/boom joint &mdash; I added four diamond-shaped
external patches of uni-directional carbon around this joint. <li>
Tail fin area &mdash; The tail boom is of small diameter near the end,
and can split if slotted out for the tail fin. To avoid this problem,
I mounted my fin on the left side of the boom with a shaped balsa
saddle, the whole area reinforced with CA-soaked glass cloth. Since
the fin is still quite fragile to side loads, some people recommend
some extra strengthening of the sub-fin with carbon.</ul>

<h2>Absalut</h2>

A high-performance moulded-wing model produced by Pavel Marek (Czech
Republic) &mdash; see the <a
href="http://www.rcdlg.com/prod_abs1.htm">manufacturer's home
page.</a> This design uses Drela-based airfoils. Unusually the flaps
are not full-span, as the wing tips have very slight
polyhedral. Construction quality is very good, and the model has a
very flat glide. The design has a lower aspect ratio wing than the
Highlight, with greater wing area. The wing as received weighed 146gm,
as compared to 126gm for the Highlight. My model came in at a
comparatively beefy 367gm/13oz AUW but is going on a diet, starting
with a lighter battery pack than the 4xAAA-cell pack I began with.

<h3>Known weak spots</h3>

<ul>
<li> Pod. The pod construction seems rather light (away from the wing
mount area which seems well-reinforced); early releases at least had
been reported to shatter.  I added extra layer of unidirectional
carbon.<li> Pod/boom joint. This has been reported to break, and as
for the Highlight, I added four diamond-shaped splints of carbon
around the join.  <li> Wing skins. Not really a weak point, but the
skins are definitely more subject to crush injuries than for the
Highlight. This is probably just a reflection of using less resin in
the glass lay-up to save weight. Many minor dents and dings that
appear through incautious handling can be removed by slightly wetting
the area and waiting for the underlying balsa to swell back.  </ul>
