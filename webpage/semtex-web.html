<h2>Summary</h2>

<i>Semtex</i> is a 'classical' quadrilateral spectral element DNS code that
uses the standard nodal GLL basis functions and (optionally) Fourier
expansions in a homogeneous direction to provide three-dimensional
solutions. If your problem has a natural periodic coordinate direction
in 3D (a cylindrical coordinate system is perhaps the most obvious
example), <i>semtex</i> could be a good choice. 

<p>

The code's lineage can be traced back through Ron
Henderson's <i>prism</i> code and ultimately to the original spectral
element code <i>nekton</i> &mdash; in many ways the implementation is
similar to <i>prism</i> (see Henderson & Karniadakis (1995) <i>J
Comput Phys</i>
<b>122</b>: 191&ndash;217) but without mortar element patching or mesh
adaptation.  One noteworthy difference is that <i>semtex</i> supports
cylindrical as well as Cartesian coordinates, and with full spectral
convergence in all directions: see <a href="./index.html#bs04">
Blackburn & Sherwin (2004)</a> <i>J Comput Phys</i>
<b>197</b>: 759&ndash;778 for a detailed description of the method.
For three-dimensional solutions the code may be run in parallel using
MPI. In addition to an incompressible Navier&ndash;Stokes solver,
source is also provided for an elliptic solver that will deal with
Laplace, Poisson and Helmholtz problems.

<p>

Please note that <i>semtex</i> is a research code and is provided 'as-is'
with the understanding that it will be used mainly by other
computer-literate researchers in computational fluid dynamics.  It is
<b>not</b> guaranteed to work or to provide correct results, and
neither I or any employer accept any liability for detriment or loss
consequent on your use of the code.  Please see the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">Gnu General
Public License (GPL)</a> under which the code is released for public
use. On the other hand, I'd be happy to hear of your experiences with
using the code and your types of applications and results.

<p>

If through your use of the code you manage to obtain publishable
results, I would be pleased if you could
cite <a href="./index.html#bs04"> Blackburn & Sherwin (2004)</a>,
where the numerical method is described in some depth, particular to
the cylindrical-coordinate formulation.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<i>Semtex</i> has been compiled and run on a variety of Unix systems.
Consult the user guide for system requirements and compilation steps.
As a minimum, your system will need C++, C and F77 (or later FORTRAN)
compilers, the Gnu version of make, as well as BLAS and LAPACK
libraries.  For parallel compilation you'll need MPI libraries.  Most
of these things are readily available on modern Unix systems.  The
starting point if you have difficulty compiling (after consulting the
user guide) is src/Makefile &mdash; quite likely you will find a set
of compiler flags for a machine similar to the one you have, and
reading it may help you diagnose and fix the problem.

<p>

I'm afraid that I do not have much time to answer routine questions
about making <i>semtex</i> compile, running examples, etc. Please
consult the user guide for information on these matters. I will be
happy to hear of bugs, and even better, suggestions about how to fix
them, although I cannot promise to remedy problems on a timely basis
(and a big <i>thank you</i> to those who have contributed fixes to
some niggling bugs).  The source code distribution is occasionally
updated, however, the code is quite mature now and does not often
change.

<h2>Mesh generation</h2>

Mesh generation can be a significant hurdle to new users. The source
distribution provides two utilities that can be used as a starting
point: <i>rectmesh</i> that generates <i>semtex</i> structured
rectangular meshes and <i>mapmesh</i> which will map such a mesh (or
any other semtex mesh) according to functions supplied on the command
line. In addition there are a number of example meshes supplied in the
'mesh' subdirectory of the source distribution (most of which were
generated by hand).

<p>

More recently we supply two utilities that work with 3rd-party mesh generators.

<i>semtex</i> session files from quad meshes generated by <i>gmsh</i>
(open-source: see <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/">

current source code distribution.
