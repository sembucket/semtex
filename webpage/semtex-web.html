<p>

Semtex is a 'classical' quadrilateral spectral element DNS code that
uses the standard nodal GLL basis functions and (optionally) Fourier
expansions in a homogeneous direction to provide three-dimensional
solutions.  Its lineage can be traced back through Ron Henderson's
Prism code to Nekton &mdash; in many ways the implementation is similar
to Ron's code (see Henderson & Karniadakis (1995) <i>J Comput Phys</i>
<b>122</b>: 191&ndash;217) but without mortar element patching or mesh
adaptation.  One noteworthy difference is that Semtex supports
cylindrical coordinate systems, and with full spectral convergence in
all directions: see <a href="./index.html#bs04"> Blackburn & Sherwin
(2004)</a> <i>J Comput Phys</i>
<b>197</b>: 759&ndash;778 for a description of the method.  For
three-dimensional solutions the code may be run in parallel using
MPI. In addition to an incompressible Navier&ndash;Stokes solver,
source is also provided for an elliptic solver that will deal with
Laplace, Poisson and Helmholtz problems.

<p>

Please note that Semtex is a 'research code' and is provided 'as-is'
with the understanding that it will be used mainly by other
computer-literate researchers in computational fluid dynamics.  It is
<b>not</b> guaranteed to work or to provide correct results, and
neither I or any employer accept any liability for detriment or loss
consequent on your use of the code.  Please see the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">Gnu General
Public License (GPL)</a> under which the code is released for public
use. On the other hand, I'd be happy to hear of your experiences with
using the code and your types of applications and results.

<p>

I'm afraid that I do not have much time to answer routine questions
about making Semtex compile, running examples, etc. Please consult the
<a href="./semtex-user.pdf">user guide (PDF)</a> for information on
these matters. Of course, I will be happy to hear of bugs, and even
better, suggestions about how to fix them, although I cannot promise
to remedy problems on a timely basis.  The source code distribution is
updated automatically every week from its CVS repository, however, the
code is quite mature now and does not often change.

<p>

Here is the source code <a href="./semtex.tgz">tarball</a>.  Semtex
has been compiled and run on a variety of Unix systems.  Consult the
user guide for system requirements and compilation steps.  As a
minimum, your system will need C++, C and F77 (or later FORTRAN)
compilers, the Gnu version of make, as well as BLAS and LAPACK
libraries.  For parallel compilation you'll need MPI libraries.  Most
of these things are readily available on modern Unix systems.  The
starting point if you have difficulty compiling (after consulting the
user guide) is src/Makefile &mdash; quite likely you will find a set
of compiler flags for a machine similar to the one you have, and
reading it may help you diagnose and fix the problem.

<p>

If through your use of the code you manage to obtain publishable
results, I would be pleased if you could cite <a
href="./index.html#bs04"> Blackburn & Sherwin (2004)</a> <i>J Comput
Phys</i>
<b>197</b>: 759&ndash;778, where the numerical method is described.
