<h2>Summary</h2>

<i>Semtex</i> is a 'classical' quadrilateral spectral element DNS code
that uses the standard nodal GLL basis functions and (optionally)
Fourier expansions in a homogeneous direction to provide
three-dimensional solutions. If your problem has a natural periodic
coordinate direction in 3D (a cylindrical coordinate system is perhaps
the most obvious example), <i>semtex</i> could be a good choice.  For
3D problems of this kind, the code can run in parallel using MPI to
distribute jobs over a number of processes; <i>semtex</i> is equally
at home on Unix machines from laptop to supercomputer.

<p>

The code's lineage can be traced back through Ron
Henderson's <i>prism</i> code and ultimately to the original spectral
element code <i>nekton</i> &mdash; in many ways the implementation is
similar to <i>prism</i> (see Henderson & Karniadakis (1995) <i>J
Comput Phys</i>
<b>122</b>: 191&ndash;217) but without mortar element patching or mesh
adaptation.  One noteworthy difference is that <i>semtex</i> supports
cylindrical as well as Cartesian coordinates, and with full spectral
convergence in all directions: see <a href="./index.html#bs04">
Blackburn & Sherwin (2004)</a> <i>J Comput Phys</i>
<b>197</b>: 759&ndash;778 for a detailed description of the method.
In addition to an incompressible Navier&ndash;Stokes solver, source is
also provided for an elliptic solver that will deal with Laplace,
Poisson and Helmholtz problems.

<p>

Please note that <i>semtex</i> is a research code and is provided 'as-is'
with the understanding that it will be used mainly by other
computer-literate researchers in computational fluid dynamics.  It is
<b>not</b> guaranteed to work or to provide correct results, and
neither I or any employer accept any liability for detriment or loss
consequent on your use of the code.  Please see the terms of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">Gnu General
Public License (GPL)</a> under which the code is released for public
use. On the other hand, I'd be happy to hear of your experiences with
using the code and your types of applications and results.

<p>

If through your use of the code you manage to obtain publishable
results, I would be pleased if you could
cite <a href="./index.html#bs04"> Blackburn & Sherwin (2004)</a>,
where the numerical method is described in some depth, particular to
the cylindrical-coordinate formulation.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<i>Semtex</i> has been compiled and run on a variety of Unix systems.
Consult the user guide for system requirements and compilation steps.
As a minimum, your system will need C++, C and F77 (or later FORTRAN)
compilers, the Gnu version of make, as well as BLAS and LAPACK
libraries.  For parallel compilation you'll need MPI libraries.  Most
of these things are readily available on modern Unix systems.  The
starting point if you have difficulty compiling (after consulting the
user guide) is src/Makefile &mdash; quite likely you will find a set
of compiler flags for a machine similar to the one you have, and
reading it may help you diagnose and fix the problem.



<p>

I'm afraid that I do not have much time to answer routine questions
about making <i>semtex</i> compile, running examples, etc. Please
consult the user guide for information on these matters. I will be
happy to hear of bugs, and even better, suggestions about how to fix
them, although I cannot promise to remedy problems on a timely basis
(and a big <i>thank you</i> to those who have contributed fixes to
some niggling bugs).  The source code distribution is occasionally
updated, however, the code is quite mature now and does not often
change.

<h2>Mesh generation</h2>

Mesh generation can be a significant hurdle to new users. The source
distribution provides two utilities that can be used as a starting
point: <i>rectmesh</i> that generates <i>semtex</i> structured
rectangular meshes and <i>mapmesh</i> which will map such a mesh (or
any other semtex mesh) according to functions supplied on the command
line. In addition there are a number of example meshes supplied in the
'mesh' subdirectory of the source distribution (most of which were
generated by hand).

<p>

More recently we supply two utilities that work with 3rd-party mesh
generators, and a standalone isosurface visualisation tool.

<p>

<!-- <img src="./icon/New_icons_10.gif" width=35 height=15> (May 2010)
--> <a href="./src/gmsh2sem.py">Python script</a> that will produce
<i>semtex</i> session files from quad meshes generated by <i>gmsh</i>
(open-source: see <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/">
http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/</a>). This utility is included in the
current source code distribution.

Stiller</a> from the ILR group

With user guides in German and
English. <a href="./src/gambit2semtex.tgz">Source code</a>. With the
deletion of <i>gambit</i> from the Ansys code suite, note that the
Ansys <i>workbench</i> Fluent .msh format is the same
as <i>gambit</i>'s, albiet in binary. To get an ASCII .msh file (the
starting point for <i>gambit2semtex</i>), set environment variable
AWP_WRITE_FLUENT_MESH_ASCII=1 before using <i>workbench</i>.


<h2>Postprocessing and visualisation</h2>

A number of tools are distributed with the code (in the utilities
directory) that will aid in postprocessing. These include tools for
addition of derived fields such as vorticity and energy, data
extraction on points, lines or planes, data projection/interpolation
and computation of Reynolds stresses.

<p>

While the user guide shows a number of visualisations made with the
commercial Tecplot code, one can also convert output data files to VTK
format, allowing the use of VisIt or Paraview.

<h2>Downloads</h2>


<a href="./src/semtex-V7_4.tgz"><i>Semtex</i> release 7_4 (October
2013)</a>. Spectral Vanishing Viscosity (SVV) has been added to the
standard DNS code, but is inactive by default. Consult Koal, Stiller &
Blackburn (2012), JCP 231 and src/svv.C.
<p>
<a href="./src/semtex-V7_3.tgz"><i>Semtex</i> release 7_3 (October
2013)</a>. This version employs the "alternating skew symmetric" form
of the nonlinear terms in the Navier&ndash;Stokes equations (for speed
and robustness) by default (though other forms are also available),
and does not employ any form of dealiasing (in the interests of
simplicity for potential users of the API).  Also it includes code for
a variety of spatially-varying body forces, including localised
damping (sponge regions) and Coriolis effects, coded by Thomas
Albrecht.
<p>
<a href="./src/semtex-V6_final.tgz">Final Version 6 (2013)</a>.
<p>
<a href="./src/gambit2semtex.tgz">Gambit2semtex tarball</a>:
postprocess Gambit output to produce semtex session files.
<p>
<a href="./src/sview.tgz">Sview tarball</a>: openGL-based isosurface
visualisation tool, works directly with <i>semtex</i> mesh and field
file dumps.  Scriptable and/or interactive, generate TIFF output.


<h2>User guide</h2>
